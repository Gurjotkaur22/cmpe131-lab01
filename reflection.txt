Using branches is powerful because it allows multiple software engineers to work on the same project at the same time without interfering with each other’s work. Each branch acts like a safe workspace where new features, bug fixes, or experiments can be developed and tested before being merged into the main project. This separation reduces the risk of breaking the main branch and gives teams the flexibility to try different approaches in parallel.

Branches also prevent common collaboration problems such as overwriting someone else’s code or introducing errors directly into the production-ready version. They support safer code reviews, easier testing, and controlled integration of changes. By using branches effectively, teams can maintain cleaner project history, minimize conflicts, and ensure the main branch stays stable and functional.
